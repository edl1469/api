# Campus Authentication API

This API allows registered users to authenticate the campus community via an API URL. Once registered, the user is given a unique API Token which must
be included as one of 3 POST parameters (BeachID and Password are the other 2). Posting these values to the API URL will return a simple true
or false response from the API. Users can then incorporate this process into their own applications.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
